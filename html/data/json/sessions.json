We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

Bootstrap is \"the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\" [2].  Bootstrap was chosen as the foundation for PatternFly because many of product development teams within Red Hat had already implemented Bootstrap in their applications or were looking to do so. But Bootstrap alone did not cover every need of Red Hat's application development teams, so PatternFly incorporates other widgets and functionality in addition to a custom look and feel that distinctly brands each product that utilizes it.  This session will show you how to use Bootstrap to create a common UI across a portfolio of products, using Red Hat's creation of PatternFly as an illustration.\r\n\r\n[1] https:\/\/www.patternfly.org\r\n[2] http:\/\/getbootstrap.com",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4.

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

Bootstrap is \"the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\" [2].  Bootstrap was chosen as the foundation for PatternFly because many of product development teams within Red Hat had already implemented Bootstrap in their applications or were looking to do so. But Bootstrap alone did not cover every need of Red Hat's application development teams, so PatternFly incorporates other widgets and functionality in addition to a custom look and feel that distinctly brands each product that utilizes it.  This session will show you how to use Bootstrap to create a common UI across a portfolio of products, using Red Hat's creation of PatternFly as an illustration.\r\n\r\n[1] https:\/\/www.patternfly.org\r\n[2] http:\/\/getbootstrap.com",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

As developers, we model these concepts and their relationships all the time in our heads, on whiteboards, and in code. Then we perform mental gymnastics translating objects and relationships into tables, rows and columns. Wouldn't it be better if our data storage thought the same way we do? This session describes a few types of problems that relational databases and many contemporary NOSQL solutions have trouble modeling, and how graph databases are a solution to those problems. Along the way, we will be introduced to the graph database Neo4j, will see how to interact with it via the Cypher query language, and learn how to start modeling our own application data as graphs.",

And in other languages too! We'll look at some of the problems that Dependency Injection helps to solve; we'll look at some related concepts such as \"aspect oriented programming\" (AOP), and inversion of control (IOC); and show you how adding a DI framework to your app might be just the magic your app needs!\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\r\n\r\nPeople that want to know what Dependency Injection is and when\/why I should use it. You've heard other terms like \"inversion of control\" and \"aspect oriented programming\" thrown around and aren't sure what they mean. Maybe you're a FW\/1 user and want to know why everyone is excited that the new version of FW\/1 will include DI\/1. Or you just want to know what ColdSpring does -- we'll cover that too. (This talk will not be ColdFusion specific. Java and JavaScript programmers will equally benefit from the content.)\r\n\r\nAssumed Knowledge\r\n\r\nFor this talk we'll assume you are pretty familiar with classes and objects (in whatever language you prefer...JavaScript, ColdFusion, etc). You've built a variety of classes\/objects in some of your projects, and are familiar with OO concepts such as inheritance and composition.\r\n\r\nMain Points\r\n\r\n1. What is Dependency Injection?\r\n2. When \/ why would I use this in my projects?\r\n3. Intro to Aspect-Oriented Programming (or AOP).\r\n4. Intro to Inversion of Control (IOC).\r\n5.

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

How does we transform our raw code to a deployable asset? The answer to this seemingly simply question can be pretty complicated.\r\n\r\nThe simple answer could be to bury your head in the sand and do nothing. You could even do a whole bunch of manual stuff but both of those options suck. A better solution is to use a task automation tool and Grunt may be the right tool for you.\r\n\r\nIf your project requires the ability to transform, validate, compile, along with much more you will need a higher level tool to perform these actions. One such tool is GruntJs. In this session we will learn how to use GruntJs to build, transform and deploy a web project.",

Bootstrap was chosen as the foundation for PatternFly because many of product development teams within Red Hat had already implemented Bootstrap in their applications or were looking to do so. But Bootstrap alone did not cover every need of Red Hat's application development teams, so PatternFly incorporates other widgets and functionality in addition to a custom look and feel that distinctly brands each product that utilizes it.

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.

Your business logic is probably fine, its just the code that needs an overhaul.  \r\n\r\nThis session, based on an actual case, offers ideas on how to massage that old embarrassing code into something you can understand, troubleshoot, and even proudly show off. Your will learn about documentation strategies that help you map out the logic, hear suggestions on  how to modularize your application, get tips on using testing and frameworks to smooth out the process, and find out about what pitfalls could befall (and have befallen) the process.  The most important takeaway though will be that slow and steady wins the race. The session offers a road map on how to tame that legacy beast in manageable steps without being overwhelmed.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of the code discussed will center around ColdFusion with some discussion of JavaScript as well.\r\n\r\nPull that legacy code out of the past and save your sanity in the process!",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that.

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently.

Node.js already has a bit of a learning curve to understand its nuances and strengths -- so let's instead learn the platform from the ground up.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover Node's many core components and how to utilize external libraries. From there, we'll learn how to leverage Node.js in shell scripting, and cover specific use cases like using streaming for data transformation and injestion, watching directories for changes, forking multiple processes and wranging asyncronous workflow.\r\n\r\nStrong experience with Javascript is recommended.",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

        "description": "Programming and databases go together like peas and carrots. It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).  Regardless of the programming language you use, if you use SQL Server you\u2019ll want to attend this session.",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4.

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

Bootstrap is \"the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\" [2].  Bootstrap was chosen as the foundation for PatternFly because many of product development teams within Red Hat had already implemented Bootstrap in their applications or were looking to do so. But Bootstrap alone did not cover every need of Red Hat's application development teams, so PatternFly incorporates other widgets and functionality in addition to a custom look and feel that distinctly brands each product that utilizes it.  This session will show you how to use Bootstrap to create a common UI across a portfolio of products, using Red Hat's creation of PatternFly as an illustration.\r\n\r\n[1] https:\/\/www.patternfly.org\r\n[2] http:\/\/getbootstrap.com",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

        "description": "Dependency Injection is a very common pattern used in modern web development. It's not specific to Java or ColdFusion or JavaScript...but it's equally awesome in all of those! And in other languages too! We'll look at some of the problems that Dependency Injection helps to solve; we'll look at some related concepts such as \"aspect oriented programming\" (AOP), and inversion of control (IOC); and show you how adding a DI framework to your app might be just the magic your app needs!\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\r\n\r\nPeople that want to know what Dependency Injection is and when\/why I should use it. You've heard other terms like \"inversion of control\" and \"aspect oriented programming\" thrown around and aren't sure what they mean. Maybe you're a FW\/1 user and want to know why everyone is excited that the new version of FW\/1 will include DI\/1. Or you just want to know what ColdSpring does -- we'll cover that too. (This talk will not be ColdFusion specific. Java and JavaScript programmers will equally benefit from the content.)\r\n\r\nAssumed Knowledge\r\n\r\nFor this talk we'll assume you are pretty familiar with classes and objects (in whatever language you prefer...JavaScript, ColdFusion, etc). You've built a variety of classes\/objects in some of your projects, and are familiar with OO concepts such as inheritance and composition.\r\n\r\nMain Points\r\n\r\n1. What is Dependency Injection?\r\n2. When \/ why would I use this in my projects?\r\n3. Intro to Aspect-Oriented Programming (or AOP).\r\n4. Intro to Inversion of Control (IOC).\r\n5. What is \"Bean Management\"?\r\n6. Code samples in a variety of languages showing when it might be useful to add some DI magic into your application.",

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

Bootstrap was chosen as the foundation for PatternFly because many of product development teams within Red Hat had already implemented Bootstrap in their applications or were looking to do so. But Bootstrap alone did not cover every need of Red Hat's application development teams, so PatternFly incorporates other widgets and functionality in addition to a custom look and feel that distinctly brands each product that utilizes it.

Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that.

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that.

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

Bootstrap is \"the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\" [2].  Bootstrap was chosen as the foundation for PatternFly because many of product development teams within Red Hat had already implemented Bootstrap in their applications or were looking to do so. But Bootstrap alone did not cover every need of Red Hat's application development teams, so PatternFly incorporates other widgets and functionality in addition to a custom look and feel that distinctly brands each product that utilizes it.  This session will show you how to use Bootstrap to create a common UI across a portfolio of products, using Red Hat's creation of PatternFly as an illustration.\r\n\r\n[1] https:\/\/www.patternfly.org\r\n[2] http:\/\/getbootstrap.com",

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4.

And in other languages too! We'll look at some of the problems that Dependency Injection helps to solve; we'll look at some related concepts such as \"aspect oriented programming\" (AOP), and inversion of control (IOC); and show you how adding a DI framework to your app might be just the magic your app needs!\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\r\n\r\nPeople that want to know what Dependency Injection is and when\/why I should use it. You've heard other terms like \"inversion of control\" and \"aspect oriented programming\" thrown around and aren't sure what they mean. Maybe you're a FW\/1 user and want to know why everyone is excited that the new version of FW\/1 will include DI\/1. Or you just want to know what ColdSpring does -- we'll cover that too. (This talk will not be ColdFusion specific. Java and JavaScript programmers will equally benefit from the content.)\r\n\r\nAssumed Knowledge\r\n\r\nFor this talk we'll assume you are pretty familiar with classes and objects (in whatever language you prefer...JavaScript, ColdFusion, etc).

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).

We'll look at the pros and cons of solutions in these situations and the lessons hopefully learned along the way.\r\n\r\nDescription of target audience: Developers that write apps in the real world, that have deadlines, and have to solve real problems that don't always fit nicely in a box.\r\n\r\nAssumed knowledge for the topic: Intermediate level of ColdFusion (or similar language) and some experience with OOP (but by no means will you need to be an expert...in fact, if you call yourself an 'expert' you'll probably think this talk is beneath you...and if that's the case, I'd encourage you to attend even moreso. ;)\r\n\r\nObjective of the topic: We all see lots of \"well I would never do it THAT way\" comments on blog posts, mailing lists, and the all-mighty Stack Overflow. But what about when you HAVE to do it that way? Let's look at some of these situations and talk about different solutions that might not be the most elegant, but solved the problem, and helped us learn something for making the next version of our app better.\r\n\r\nQualification: I've been running a software consulting business for the last 6 years. Several of my big projects have involved inheriting large spaghetti-code projects, and having to figure out ways to add new features without rewriting everything from scratch. This isn't always clean, or elegant. The goal isn't always to write something that is blog-worthy, the goal is to solve a client's issue in the given time-frame, often with a terrible codebase.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\n1. When is it BETTER to have errors emailed to the team instead of stored in a logging tool (Yes, there is a time for this).\r\n2. Can you do things like add Bootstrap to an old table-based web app? (Yes, there are still some of these out in the wild.) And what happens when you do so?\r\n3. An explanation of technical debt and why it's important.\r\n4. Some real code situations where incurring a little technical debt was necessary.\r\n5. Some lessons learned when these situations have presented themselves, so we can improve things in the future.",

This session describes a few types of problems that relational databases and many contemporary NOSQL solutions have trouble modeling, and how graph databases are a solution to those problems.

And in other languages too! We'll look at some of the problems that Dependency Injection helps to solve; we'll look at some related concepts such as \"aspect oriented programming\" (AOP), and inversion of control (IOC); and show you how adding a DI framework to your app might be just the magic your app needs!\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\r\n\r\nPeople that want to know what Dependency Injection is and when\/why I should use it. You've heard other terms like \"inversion of control\" and \"aspect oriented programming\" thrown around and aren't sure what they mean. Maybe you're a FW\/1 user and want to know why everyone is excited that the new version of FW\/1 will include DI\/1. Or you just want to know what ColdSpring does -- we'll cover that too.

It doesn't matter if you are building a web application, a mobile application, desktop software, or an API, chances are it is interacting with a database of some sort. Unfortunately, most programmers don't know enough about database systems to really use them to their full potential. Sure, they may have plenty of practice creating things like tables and stored procedures, but very few of them get the opportunity to go much beyond that. I know this, because I was once one of those programmers. I would just use the database for not much more than a simple container for storing information.\r\n\r\nBut that changed recently. After having moved full time into the world of databases I've learned many new things that would have made my life as a programmer easier and my applications much more efficient.  In this session I will discuss some useful features in Microsoft SQL Server that you probably aren't aware of.  Highlighting each specific feature, how you can use it, and why you should use it, I will provide direct explanations that can be incorporated immediately into your daily development (without all of the overly technical DBA mumbo-jumbo).
