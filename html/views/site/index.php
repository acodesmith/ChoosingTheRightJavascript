        <p>Single page applications (SPA) are becoming more popular everyday. Due to their lack of reloading, fast interactivity and ability to separate the visual presentation from database activity
            a Single Page Application can turn a simple product into an impressive presentation.
            Complicated template logic can be hard to manage for a large project and some javascript
            frameworks can be overkill. We will analyze how each framework came to be, who maintains the codebase and top level components.</p>

                        jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
                        It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
                        event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API
                        that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of
                        versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

                        Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events,
                        collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling,
                        and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.</p>

                        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application.
                        The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
                        AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development.
                        It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
